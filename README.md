# GazeBubble_Dataset
This is the data set to analysis the participants eye-in-head angle. 
We collected data over the entire process, amounting to 3,366,925 frames and lasting approximately 12 hours in total. 
Our analysis focused solely when participants successfully completed a 2-second sustained gaze on the target, total 1,295,037 frames. 
The data includes participants’ eye positions and direction vectors, head positions and direction vectors, the name of the triggered target (or ’None’ if no target was triggered), task target name and position, and experimental parameters such as density, target depth, and target size. Contributing to a better understanding of participants’ target acquisition behavior and aiding in the design and evaluation of future gaze-based interaction techniques.
